>>> (18-Apr 23:49:48) : I wanna know how to scan for SMB vulnerability using NMAP

Sure, I can help you with that. To scan for SMB vulnerability using NMAP, you can use the following command:```
nmap -p 139,445 --script smb-vuln* <target IP>
```

This command will scan for open ports 139 and 445, which are commonly used by SMB, and run all SMB vulnerability scripts available in NMAP. The output will show you any vulnerabilities that are found on the target system.

It's important to note that scanning for vulnerabilities without permission is illegal and can result in serious consequences. Make sure you have permission from the owner of the system before conducting any vulnerability scans.
